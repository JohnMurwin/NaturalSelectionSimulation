    Welcome to Team 1's Spring 2022 Final Project for SWE7903 - Software Engineering Capstone. 
    This project serves to help teach students how the process of Natural Selection contributes to Evolution inside of an ecosystem in an interactive way through a video game interface. 
    In addition, this project will be used to research how a full-featured Continuous Integration and Deployment pipeline increases software quality, speed, and delivery times.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
### Description
This project is an advanced Artificial Intelligence simulation that has multiple species of animals interacting in a procedurally-generated environment. 
The traits of these animals can be configured by the player such that they can see the effects of various decisions such as size, fur color, speed, among other traits. 
Once the simulation begins, players will be able to watch as the ecosystem survives, thrives, or dies due to the choices in species design. In combination, the project will
feature a data-output system that can be used to derive important points in the lifecycle of the ecosystem during the simulation. 

   Lastly, the project will be accompanied by a host of SWE best practices such as Static Code Analysis, Linting, native Testing systems, Code Coverage, and a end-to-end Continuous Integration and 
Delivery pipeline structure off of Github Actions custom written for this project. 


### Key Features:
- Fully intelligent AI animals 
- Procedurally generated environment
